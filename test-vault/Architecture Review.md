# Architecture Review Meeting

**Date:** January 12, 2024  
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Location:** Engineering Conference Room

## Attendees
- [[Alex Thompson]] - Tech Lead (Meeting Lead)
- [[David Kim]] - Senior Developer
- [[Marcus Rodriguez]] - Engineering Manager
- [[Sarah Chen]] - Product Manager

## Purpose
Technical deep dive into [[Feature X]] architecture and [[API Redesign]] approach.

## Agenda
1. [[Feature X]] Technical Architecture Presentation
2. [[Database Migration]] Strategy Discussion
3. [[API Redesign]] Technical Approach
4. Performance and Scalability Considerations
5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

## Key Decisions

### Architecture Approach
[[Alex Thompson]] presented microservices architecture for [[Feature X]]. Team agreed on:
- Service decomposition strategy
- Inter-service communication patterns
- Data consistency approaches

### Database Strategy
[[David Kim]] proposed phased approach to [[Database Migration]]:
- Phase 1: Schema optimization (Q1 2024)
- Phase 2: Service separation (Q2 2024)
- Phase 3: Full migration (Q3 2024)

### API Design
Standardization approach for [[API Redesign]]:
- RESTful conventions
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive documentation

## Technical Concerns Addressed
- Performance impact of microservices
- Data consistency across services
- Deployment and monitoring complexity
- Integration with [[Emma Wilson]]'s frontend work

## Risk Mitigation
- Prototype development before full implementation
- Gradual rollout strategy
- Comprehensive testing approach
- Rollback procedures

## Action Items
- [ ] [[Alex Thompson]] - Create detailed technical specification
- [ ] [[David Kim]] - Prototype API design patterns
- [ ] [[Marcus Rodriguez]] - Resource allocation planning
- [ ] [[Sarah Chen]] - Stakeholder communication plan

## Follow-up
- Weekly architecture sync meetings
- Code review process establishment
- Integration testing with [[Lisa Park]]'s design requirements
