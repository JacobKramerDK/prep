# Database Migration Project

## Overview
Strategic migration to improve database performance, scalability, and support for [[Feature X]] requirements.

## Project Context
Originally planned for Q4 2024, postponed to Q1 2025 during [[Q4 Planning Meeting]] to prioritize [[Feature X]] delivery.

## Technical Lead
- **Architecture:** [[Alex Thompson]]
- **Implementation:** [[David Kim]]
- **Project Management:** [[Marcus Rodriguez]]
- **Product Requirements:** [[Sarah Chen]]

## Migration Strategy
Phased approach proposed by [[David Kim]] in [[Architecture Review]]:

### Phase 1: Schema Optimization (Q1 2024)
- Index optimization
- Query performance improvements
- Data cleanup and archival

### Phase 2: Service Separation (Q2 2024)
- Microservices data boundaries
- Service-specific databases
- Data synchronization patterns

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Q3 2024)
- New database platform migration
- Legacy system decommissioning
- Performance validation

## Dependencies
- [[Feature X]] completion and stabilization
- [[API Redesign]] implementation
- Infrastructure capacity planning

## Impact Assessment
- Supports [[Feature X]] scalability requirements
- Enables [[API Redesign]] performance goals
- Reduces technical debt
- Improves system reliability

## Stakeholder Coordination
- [[Sarah Chen]] - Business impact and timeline coordination
- [[Alex Thompson]] - Technical architecture and risk assessment
- [[Marcus Rodriguez]] - Resource planning and team coordination
- [[David Kim]] - Implementation planning and execution

## Risk Factors
- Data migration complexity
- Downtime requirements
- Integration testing scope
- Rollback procedures

## Success Metrics
- Query performance improvements (target: 60% faster)
- System availability during migration (target: 99.9%)
- Zero data loss
- Successful [[Feature X]] integration
