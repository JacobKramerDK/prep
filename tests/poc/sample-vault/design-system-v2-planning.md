# Design System v2.0 Planning

## Overview
Planning document for the next major version of our design system, focusing on improved consistency, accessibility, and developer experience.

## Current Challenges
- Inconsistent component implementations across teams
- Limited accessibility support
- Outdated color palette and typography
- Poor documentation and examples

## Goals for v2.0
1. **Consistency**: Unified component library across all products
2. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all components
3. **Developer Experience**: Better documentation, TypeScript support
4. **Performance**: Optimized bundle sizes and loading

## Key Components to Update

### Typography System
- New font stack with better readability
- Consistent sizing scale (1.125 ratio)
- Improved line heights and spacing

### Color Palette
- Expanded color system with semantic naming
- Dark mode support
- Better contrast ratios for accessibility

### Component Library
- Button variants and states
- Form components with validation
- Navigation and layout components
- Data display components

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Core tokens and foundations (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Basic components (3 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Complex components (4 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and migration guides (2 weeks)

## Migration Timeline
- **February**: Internal team migration
- **March**: Gradual rollout to other teams
- **April**: Complete migration and deprecate v1.0

## Success Metrics
- 95% component adoption across teams
- 50% reduction in design inconsistencies
- 100% accessibility compliance
- 30% improvement in developer satisfaction scores
